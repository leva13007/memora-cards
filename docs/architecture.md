# Architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Vite?

We chose Vite as the bundler for Memora Cards for the following reasons:

âœ… Lightning-fast development server and build  
âœ… Built-in TypeScript and JSX support  
âœ… Native ESModules and modern browser-first approach  
âœ… Simple configuration, easy onboarding for contributors  
âœ… Supports progressive enhancement (PWA, code splitting, etc.)  
âœ… No need for SSR, so Next.js is overkill  
âœ… Better long-term maintainability than CRA or Webpack

ðŸ“Œ This decision may be revisited in future if server-side rendering or static generation becomes a requirement.

```bash
pnpm create vite . --template react-ts
```

## ðŸ“¦ Why pnpm?

We use **pnpm** as our package manager because it is:

âœ… Faster than npm or Yarn  
âœ… Workspace-ready and monorepo-friendly  
âœ… Widely adopted in the modern frontend ecosystem  
âœ… Reduces `node_modules` size via hardlinks  
âœ… Fully compatible with Vite, React, and TypeScript

To get started:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

## ðŸ”’ Dependency Versioning Strategy

To ensure long-term stability and reproducibility of builds and tutorials:

- All packages are added with **exact version locking**
- No `^` or `latest` is used
- `.npmrc` includes `save-exact=true`
- The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is committed and must not be modified manually

> This guarantees that contributors and viewers using this project months or years later will get the exact same dependency tree.

Forcing this strategy may lead to occasional dependency conflicts. In such cases, we use the `overrides` field in `package.json` to resolve them. For example:
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "some-lib": "1.2.3"
  }
}
```
